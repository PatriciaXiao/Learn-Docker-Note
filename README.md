# Learn-Docker-Note
 My Note learning docker as a beginner

## Motivation
- To running with my own environmental settings on Github without root permission (and I actually don't think I should have it, root is evil for a beginner like me)
- To not setting the environment again and again from place to place; I want something that could quickly get it run anywhere.
