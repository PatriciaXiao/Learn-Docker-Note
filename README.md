# Learn-Docker-Note
 My Note learning docker as a beginner

## Motivation
- To running with my own environmental settings on Github without root permission (and I actually don't think I should have it, root is evil for a beginner like me)
- To not setting the environment again and again from place to place; I want something that could quickly get it run anywhere.

## Tools
- On our lab's server (Scai1) the Docker is already well-installed
- For learning purpose I also [installed Docker-Desktop on my local mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

## Tutorials
- [official tutorial upon installing](https://hub.docker.com/?overlay=onboarding)
    * official example contained [here](https://github.com/docker/doodle), I put the examples and the readme in [./official-examples/](./official-examples/)
